# alarme-a-gnac
Simple home alarm system.

I recently bought a crappy home alarm system. It is so bad that I decided to remake it (almost) from scratch, I will only reuse the wirelesse sensors.

I do this for fun. If you really want a secure alarm for your home, buy an expensive one.
The wireless remotes and sensors are easily spoofed.

Planned features:
 * sms/call notification
 * sms activation/desactivation
 * a big loud siren
 * tamper detection

I will use:
 * an arduino or a teensy board
 * a sim900 gsm/gprs shield
 * a cheap 433Mhz receiver for arduino
 * Owsoo alarm wirelesse sensors and remotes (433Mhz)
 * parts from my magical electronic junk box
